# #  Difference Polygon Clipping
export difference

# The 'difference' function returns the difference of two polygons. Note that this file
# currently only contains the difference of two polygons, which will always return
# a vector of a vector of a vector of tuples of floats.
# The algorithm to determine the difference was adapted from "Efficient 
# clipping of efficient polygons," by Greiner and Hormann (1998).

    difference(geom1, geom2)::Vector{Vector{Vector{Tuple{Float64}}}}

Returns the difference of geom1 minus geom2. The vector of a vector inside
the outermost vector is empty if the difference is empty. If the polygons
don't intersect, it just returns geom1.

## Example 

```jldoctest
import GeoInterface as GI, GeometryOps as GO

poly1 = GI.Polygon([[[0.0, 0.0], [5.0, 5.0], [10.0, 0.0], [5.0, -5.0], [0.0, 0.0]]])
poly2 = GI.Polygon([[[3.0, 0.0], [8.0, 5.0], [13.0, 0.0], [8.0, -5.0], [3.0, 0.0]]])
GO.difference(poly1, poly2)

# output
1-element Vector{Vector{Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}}}:
[[[(6.5, 3.5), (5.0, 5.0), (0.0, 0.0), (5.0, -5.0), (6.5, -3.5), (3.0, 0.0), (6.5, 3.5)]]]
