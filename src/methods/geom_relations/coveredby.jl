## What is coveredby?

The coveredby function checks if one geometry is covered by another geometry.
This is an extension of within that does not require the interiors of the two
geometries to intersect, but still does require that the interior and boundary
of the first geometry isn't outside of the second geometry. 

To provide an example, consider this point and line:
```@example coveredby
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie

p1 = Point(0.0, 0.0)
p2 = Point(1.0, 1.0)
l1 = Line(p1, p2)

f, a, p = lines([p1, p2])
scatter!(p1, color = :red)
```
As we can see, `p1` is on the endpoint of l1. This means it is not `within`, but
it does meet the definition of `coveredby`.
```@example coveredby
coveredby(p1, l1)  # true
```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait.

Each of these calls a method in the geom_geom_processors file. The methods in
this file determine if the given geometries meet a set of criteria. For the
`coveredby` function and arguments g1 and g2, this criteria is as follows:
    - points of g1 are allowed to be in the interior of g2 (either through
    overlap or crossing for lines)
    - points of g1 are allowed to be on the boundary of g2
    - points of g1 are not allowed to be in the exterior of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be in the interior of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be on the boundary of g2
    - no points of g1 are required to be in the exterior of g2

The code for the specific implementations is in the geom_geom_processors file.

"""
    coveredby(g1, g2)::Bool

Return `true` if the first geometry is completely covered by the second
geometry. The interior and boundary of the primary geometry (g1) must not
intersect the exterior of the secondary geometry (g2).

Furthermore, `coveredby` returns the exact opposite result of `covers`. They are
equivalent with the order of the arguments swapped.

## Examples
```jldoctest setup=:(using GeometryOps, GeometryBasics)
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
p1 = GI.Point(0.0, 0.0)
p2 = GI.Point(1.0, 1.0)
l1 = GI.Line([p1, p2])

GO.coveredby(p1, l1)
# output
true
