## What is crosses?

The crosses function checks if one geometry is crosses another geometry.
A geometry can only cross another geometry if they are either two lines, or if
one of the geometries has a smaller dimensionality than the other geometry.
If checking two lines, they must meet in one point. If checking two geometries
of different dimensions, the interiors must meet in at least one point and at
least one of the geometries must have a point outside of the other geometry.

Note that points can't cross any geometries, despite different dimension, due to
their inability to be both crosses and exterior to any other shape.

To provide an example, consider these two lines:
```@example cshape
using GeometryOps
using GeometryOps.GeometryBasics
using Makie
using CairoMakie


```

```@example cshape

```

## Implementation

This is the GeoInterface-compatible implementation.

First, we implement a wrapper method that dispatches to the correct
implementation based on the geometry trait.

...

The code for the specific implementations is in the geom_geom_processors file.

=#

"""
    crosses(geom1, geom2)::Bool

Return `true` if the first geometry crosses the second geometry. If they are
both lines, they must meet in one point. Otherwise, they must be of different
dimensions, the interiors must intersect, and the interior of the first geometry
must intersect the exterior of the secondary geometry.

## Examples
```jldoctest setup=:(using GeometryOps, GeometryBasics)
import GeometryOps as GO, GeoInterface as GI
