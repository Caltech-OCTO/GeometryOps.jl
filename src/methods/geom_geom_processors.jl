Determines if a point meets the given process checks with respect to a curve.
This curve includes just the line segments that make up the curve. Even if the
curve has a repeated last point that "closes" the curve, this function does not
include the space within the closed curve as a part of the geometry. Point
should be an object of Point trait and curve should be an object with a line
string or a linear ring trait.

If checking within, then the point must be on a segment of the line and if
checking disjoint the point must not be on any segment of the line.

Beyond specifying the process type, user can also specify if the geometry
boundaries should be included in the checks and if the curve should be closed
with repeated a repeated last coordinate matching the first coordinate.

Determine if point is in, on, or out of a closed curve, which includes the space
enclosed by the closed curve. Point should be an object of Point trait and
curve should be an object with a line string or linear ring trait, that is
assumed to be closed, regardless of repeated last point.

Returns a given in, on, or out value (defaults are 1, -1, and 0) of type T.
`In` means the point is within the closed curve (excluding edges and vertices).
`On` means the point is on an edge or a vertex of the closed curve.
`Out` means the point is outside of the closed curve.

Note that this uses the Algorithm by Hao and Sun (2018):
https://doi.org/10.3390/sym10100477
Paper seperates orientation of point and edge into 26 cases. For each case, it
is either a case where the point is on the edge (returns on), where a ray from
the point (x, y) to infinity along the line y = y cut through the edge (k += 1),
or the ray does not pass through the edge (do nothing and continue). If the ray
passes through an odd number of edges, it is within the curve, else outside of
of the curve if it didn't return 'on'.
See paper for more information on cases denoted in comments.
