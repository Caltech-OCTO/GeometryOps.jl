Determine if point is in, on, or out of a closed curve. Point should be an
object of Point trait and curve should be a linearstring or ring, that is
assumed to be closed, regardless of repeated last point.

Returns a given in, on, or out value (defaults are 1, -1, and 0) of type T.
`In` means the point is within the closed curve (excluding edges and vertices).
`On` means the point is on an edge or a vertex of the closed curve.
`Out` means the point is outside of the closed curve.

Note that this uses the Algorithm by Hao and Sun (2018):
https://doi.org/10.3390/sym10100477
Paper seperates orientation of point and edge into 26 cases. For each case, it
is either a case where the point is on the edge (returns on), where a ray from
the point (x, y) to infinity along the line y = y cut through the edge (k += 1),
or the ray does not pass through the edge (do nothing and continue). If the ray
passes through an odd number of edges, it is within the curve, else outside of
of the curve if it didn't return 'on'.
See paper for more information on cases denoted in comments.
